This year’s Memorial Day sales could be key for cash-strapped Americans feeling the sting of soaring inflation. The three-day holiday weekend generally marks a big sales push, making it a good time to stock up, “especially if it’s something you know you’re going to need,” said Simon Blanchard, an associate professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. That’s particularly true after the recent run-up in prices, Blanchard added. However, some discounts may not seem like much now compared to what things cost a year ago, he cautioned. “The reality is sales will be different because prices aren’t what they used to be.” “If you are getting 25% off and the product has shrunk by 20%, is it really that good of a deal?” There will still be plenty of good discounts out there, Julie Ramhold, a consumer analyst at DealNews.com, said of the sales which typically kick off midweek and run through Monday. “Because of inflation, the starting price may be higher, which means the sale price may not be as low as we hoped but that doesn’t mean it’s a bad deal,” she said.
